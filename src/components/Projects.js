                    <p>
                    A single-player game where your goal is to reach the finish line by avoiding obstacles.
                    Youâ€™ll have to guide your character down a level to jump gaps, roll past enemies, or choose to shoot them.
                    I completed this collaborative project with two peers at the University of Oregon.
                    Development process was managed with a Kanban board and Git was used to organize deployments.

                    <p>
                    A full stack prototype project that tracks user locations to help plan essential trips out of their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    The user mobile application will send location data to a database hosted on our school server, and allow for store visitation input such as wait time.
                    Using the data gathered the map is updated to reflect users at given locations and average wait times.
                    Users may obfuscate their location while at home to protect privacy and are identified by device id.
                    Built with five  others as a group project at the University of Oregon.

                    <p>
                    A Kaggle dataset encompassing thousands of games from League of Legends was used to train classifiers which predict the outcome.
                    The dataset was divided into three sets as to provide a training set, a development set to train hyper parameters, and a testing set to evaluate the accuracy.
