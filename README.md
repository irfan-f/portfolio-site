Welcome to my Site!

Here is where I attempt to showcase my technological feats using technology.

I am using this site as a way to maintain my knowledge of React and GitHub Pages, as well as a way to test new code styles and build paths.


I am working on this site in my spare time and hope to enter in some new content soon.
